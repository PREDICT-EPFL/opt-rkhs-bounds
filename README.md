## Description

In the above work, we propose a novel uncertainty quantification technique that bounds the out-of-sample values of an unknown real-valued function. The method is developed in the a kernel setting, and can account for finite measurement noise. 

We showcase how the theory can be used through a number of examples, including: a function bouding task, a data-driven optimization problem with unknown constraints, and the safety certification of a sequence of control actions for a dynamical system.
